## Summary

Evaluation of Search Results
It is our job, as readers, to evaluate information. Things to consider when evaluating information:
- Source: Identify the author or organization publishing the information.
- Evidence and reasoning - Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning.
- Objectivity and bias - Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives.
- Corroboration and consistency - Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources.

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

1. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products. The MITRE corporation maintains the CVE system.

2. Exploit Database - The Exploit Database lists exploit codes from various authors; some of these exploit codes are tested and marked as verified.
   Needless to say, we should try not to exploit a vulnerable system unless we are given permission, usually via a legally binding agreement.
