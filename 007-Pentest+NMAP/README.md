# TryHackMe - Pentest+NMAP Tutorial
## Date - 02/12/25

## INTRODUCTION
When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have about a target system or network, the more options you have available. This makes it imperative that proper enumeration is carried out before any exploitation attempts are made.
Say we have been given an IP (or multiple addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the "landscape" we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, 
perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this "map" of the landscape is something called port scanning.
Every computer has a total of "65535" available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports. For example a HTTP webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. An HTTPS can be found on port 443.

## NMAP Switches
Like most pentesting tools, namp is run from the terminal. These are versions available for both Windows and Linux.
Nmap can be accessed by typing <em>nmap</em> into the terminal command line, followed by some of the "switches" (command arguments which tell a program to do different things).

## Scan Types Overview
When port scanning with Nmap, there are three basic scan types. These are:
* TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
* SYN "Half-open" scans (-sS)
* UDP Scans (-sU)
Additionally, there are several less common port scan types, these are:
* TCP Null Scans (-sN)
* TCP FIN (-sF)
* TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)
Most of these (with the exception of UDP scans) are used for very similar purposes, however, the way that they work differs between each scan. This means that, whilst one of the first three scans are likely to be your go-to in most situations, it's worth bearing in mind that
other scan types exist.

## Scan Types - TCP connections
As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing
the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.
Well, as the name suggests, a TCP connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target point in turn. In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.

## Scan Types - SYN Scans
As with TCP scans, SYN scans (-sS) are used to scan the port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
Where TCP scans performs a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request)
This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:
* It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection Systems as they are looking out for a full three-way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; It is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth scans".
* SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
* Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port. SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP connection.

There are however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:
* They require sudo permissions in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
* Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a produciton environment for the test.

All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.
For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP connect.

## Scan types - UDP scans 
Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless. The switch for an Nmap UDP is (-sU).
When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being <em>open|filtered</em>. In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very 
unusual), then the port then the port is marked as open. More commonly there is no response, in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check, if there is still no response then the port is marked <i>open|filtered</i> and Nmap moves on.
When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed port, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.

## Scan types - NULL, FIN and Xmas
All three are interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN "stealth"scan. Beginning with NULL scans:
* As the name suggests, NULL scans (-sN) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.
* FIN scans (-sF) work in an almost identical fashion, however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connectin).
* As with the other two scans in this class, Xmas scans (-sX) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed port. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG, and FIN) give it
  the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in wireshark.
## Scan types - ICMP Network Scanning.
On first connection to a target network in a black box assignment, our first objective is to obtain a "map" of the network structure --or, in other words, we want to see which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which
do not.
One way to do is by using Nmap to perform a so called "ping sweep". This is exactly the as the name suggests; Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive. This is not always accurate; however, it can provide something of a baseline and thus is worth covering.
To perform a ping sweep, we use the <em><i>sn</i></em> switch in conjuction with IP range which can be specified with either a hyphen (-) or CIDR notation. i.e. we could scan the 192.168.0.x network using
* <em><i>nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254</i></em> or
* <em><i>nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24</i></em>

The <em>-sn</em> switch tells nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify target. In addition to the ICMP echo requests, the -sn switch also cause nmap to send a TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.

## NSE Scripts Overview
The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE scripts are written in the <i>Lua</i> programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things; from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance.
There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:
* <em>safe</em> - won't affect the target
* <em>intrusive</em> - Not safe, liekly to affect the target
* <em>wuln</em> - scan for vulnerabilities
* <em>exploit</em> - Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
* <em>auth</em> - Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Login into an FTP server anonymously)
* <em>brute</em> - Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
* <em>discovery</em> - Attempt to query runing services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

## NSE scripts - working with the NSE
To run a specifi script, we would use <em><i>--scrip=<script-name></i></em>, e.g. <em><i>--script=http-fileupload-exploter</i></em>.
Multiple scripts can be run simultaenously in this fashion by separating them by a comma. For example: --script=smb-enum-users, smb-enum-shares.
* Nmap scripts come with buil-in help menus, which can be accessed using <em><i>nmap --script-help <script-name></i></em>.

## Firewall Evason
Your typical windows host will, with its default firewall, block all ICMP packets. This presents a problem; not only do we often use ping to maually establish the activity of a target, Nmap does the same thing by default. This means that Nmap will register a host with this firewall configuration as dead and not bother scanning it at all.
So, we need a way to get around this configuration. Fortunately, Nmap provides an option for this <em><i>-Pn</i></em> which tells Nmap not to bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block; however, it comes at the price of potentially taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port). 

The following switches are of particular note that can be consider useful for firewall evasion, althoug there are variety of other switches. 
* <em>-f</em> - used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.
* An alternative to <em>-f</em>, but providing more control over the size of the packets: <em>--mtu <number></em>, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8.
* <em><i>--scan-delay <time>ms</i></em>: used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
* <em>--badsum</em>: This is used to generate invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.
