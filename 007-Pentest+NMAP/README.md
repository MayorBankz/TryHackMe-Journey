# TryHackMe - Pentest+NMAP Tutorial
## Date - 02/12/25

## INTRODUCTION
When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have about a target system or network, the more options you have available. This makes it imperative that proper enumeration is carried out before any exploitation attempts are made.
Say we have been given an IP (or multiple addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the "landscape" we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, 
perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this "map" of the landscape is something called port scanning.
Every computer has a total of "65535" available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports. For example a HTTP webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. An HTTPS can be found on port 443.

## NMAP Switches
Like most pentesting tools, namp is run from the terminal. These are versions available for both Windows and Linux.
Nmap can be accessed by typing <em>nmap</em> into the terminal command line, followed by some of the "switches" (command arguments which tell a program to do different things).

## Scan Types Overview
When port scanning with Nmap, there are three basic scan types. These are:
* TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
* SYN "Half-open" scans (-sS)
* UDP Scans (-sU)
Additionally, there are several less common port scan types, these are:
* TCP Null Scans (-sN)
* TCP FIN (-sF)
* TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)
Most of these (with the exception of UDP scans) are used for very similar purposes, however, the way that they work differs between each scan. This means that, whilst one of the first three scans are likely to be your go-to in most situations, it's worth bearing in mind that
other scan types exist.

## Scan Types - TCP connections
As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing
the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.
Well, as the name suggests, a TCP connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target point in turn. In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.

## Scan Types - SYN Scans
As with TCP scans, SYN scans (-sS) are used to scan the port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
Where TCP scans performs a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request)
This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:
* It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection Systems as they are looking out for a full three-way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; It is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth scans".
* SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
* Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port. SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP connection.

There are however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:
* They require sudo permissions in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
* Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a produciton environment for the test.

All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.
For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP connect.

## Scan types - UDP scans 
Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless. The switch for an Nmap UDP is (-sU).
When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being <em>open|filtered</em>. In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very 
unusual), then the port then the port is marked as open. More commonly there is no response, in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check, if there is still no response then the port is marked <i>open|filtered</i> and Nmap moves on.
When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed port, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.

## Scan types - NULL, FIN and Xmas
All three are interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN "stealth"scan. Beginning with NULL scans:
* As the name suggests, NULL scans (-sN) are when the
