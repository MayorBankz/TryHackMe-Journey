## Overview
The name Linux is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system). For example, <em>Ubuntu & Debian</em> are some of the more commonplace distributors of Linux because it is so extensible i.e you can run ubuntu as a server (such as websites & website applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop.

<em>Note: Ubuntu can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM.</em>
